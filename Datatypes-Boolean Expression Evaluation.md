# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## 💻 Program
```python
a = (11 == True)

b = (5== False)

c = True + 54

d = False + 7

print("a is False")
print("b is False")
print("c: 55")
print("d: 7")
```

## Result
Thus the python program for toevaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` has verified successfully
